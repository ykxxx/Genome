# Genome
UCLA CS32 Project

This project built a tree-based structure that enables the following features:
• Maintain a library of genomes from multiple organisms; the user can add new
genomes to this library.
• Allow the user to search the library for a specified DNA sequence and identify all
genomes in the library that contain that DNA sequence or any SNiP of it.
• Allow the user to present the genome/DNA of a new organism and quickly
identify all genomes in the library that have a high percentage of matching DNA
with the presented genome.
